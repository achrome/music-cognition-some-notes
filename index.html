      # <span class="mdi mdi-music-note"></span> Effects of Music on Cognition

      ---

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Music is one of the strongest reward systems
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>It reinforces information pathways between the temporal gyrus and the prefrontal cortex

      ---

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Immediately, it facilitates dopamine release
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>In the short term, it boosts memory and auditory processing
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Over a long duration, it forms a sense of "anticipation"
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Continued exposure to music makes subtle changes to the synaptic firing mechanisms
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>We build our own ideas of how music "should" sound like

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ### It's even better for musicians

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ## Music is structure

      ---

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Facilitates learning
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Builds dexterity and strength
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Creates an internal clock or a metronome
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Improves reflexes

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ## But sometimes, it's a matter of survival

      ---

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Regulates mental processes in kids with ADHD
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Music therapy is used to help victims of brain trauma (injury, Parkinson's, Tourette's, Asperger's etc) 
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Music arbitrates social interaction and collaboration, and thus boosts confidence

      ## Savants

      ---

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>There are less than 50 autistic savants believed to be alive today
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Around half of them are musical savants
      
      ---

      ## Tony De Blois

      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Blind and autistic
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Magna Cum Laude from Berklee School of Music
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Plays 20 musical instruments
      - <span class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></span>Can play ~8,000 pieces of music from memory

      # <span class="mdi mdi-music-note"></span> Sprinkle Some Culture on This

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ## Because music is so personalized, every person has a unique taste in music

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ### However, overall patterns of music consumption remain similar across a demographic

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ### While the auditory cues within a piece might be perceived similarly by people from two varying cultures, the impact can still be wildly different because of the difference between culture specific cues

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ## This is further reinforced by cultural stereotypes, as represented in music.

      ---
      
      class: center, middle

      ### As an example, certain substructures (a passage, interval, or chord(s)) might become associated with a certain emotional response.
